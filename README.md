# pandas-challenge

- The analysis part has been updated to the first cell in jupyter notebook file
- for Scores by School Spending, I intentionally added the two more steps below
    - Remove "$": to make the value as float type (numeric value)
    - change data type to float: without this process, I realized that the values can't be recongnized or separted by given bin
- the file name has been changed from PyCitySchools_starter to PyCitySchools_final
